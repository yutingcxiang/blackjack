Conway's Game of Life Rules:

1. If a living cell has less than two living neighbors, it is dead in the next generation, as if by underpopulation.
2. If a living cell has two or three living neighbors,itstaysalive in the next generation.
3. If a living cell has more than three living neighbors,it is dead in the next generation, as if by overcrowding.
4. If a dead cell has exactly three living neighbors, it comes to life in the next generation.
